# Changelog

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

**Renderer lifecycle**
- A column `renderer` may now return `{ element, destroy }`. The grid calls `destroy()` right before the cell element is discarded — on every re-render of the row, when the cell enters edit mode, on `clear()`, and on `grid.destroy()`. This is the hook stateful renderers (framework component instances, charts, subscriptions) were missing: the grid rebuilds every visible row on each render pass, so anything mounted into a cell without a teardown path leaked one instance per pass.
- New render hooks `beforeCellDestroy({ row, def, state, cell, value })` and `beforeRowDestroy({ row, rowElement, rowIndex })`, available through the `hooks` option and through plugin `hooks`. They mirror `beforeCellRender` / `beforeRowRender` one-to-one and fire for pinned rows too.
- `BodyRenderer.disposeCell(cell)` runs the destroy path for a single cell; `beginCellEdit()` now uses it so a mounted renderer is destroyed before the editor replaces it.

**Vue 2 adapter**
- `createVueRenderer(Component, options)` (exported from `zenith-grid/vue2`) wraps a `Vue.extend()` constructor or component options object as a cell renderer. It mounts one instance per cell, maps `{ value, row, def, state }` to `propsData` (customisable via `props`), supports `parent` for `provide/inject`/`$store`, binds `on` listeners with `vm.$on`, and returns `{ element, destroy }` so the grid `$destroy()`s the instance when the cell goes away.

### Fixed

**Teardown leaks**
- Rich tooltips (`tooltipComponent`) were only cleaned up on `mouseleave`. Disposing a cell while it was hovered — a re-render, edit start, or `grid.destroy()` — left the 400ms show timer running, so the tooltip was still appended to `document.body` after the grid was gone, and an already-visible tooltip stayed behind on re-render. The tooltip timer and element are now torn down with the cell.
- `InfiniteScrollManager.destroy()` did not invalidate an in-flight `onLoadMore()` request; a response arriving after `grid.destroy()` still fired `loadingComplete` and could re-append rows to the emptied data store. Late responses are now ignored.
- The side panel's advanced filter dialog is appended to `document.body` with a capture-phase `pointerdown` listener on `document`; neither was removed on `grid.destroy()`, leaving the dialog on screen and the grid instance reachable through the Apply handler. Both are now tracked and removed on destroy (and the toggle now closes only this grid's dialog, not another grid's).
- `WorkerBridge` created a blob URL for the inline worker but never called `URL.revokeObjectURL()`, leaking one URL and blob per grid instance. The URL is now revoked on `destroy()` and when worker construction fails.

### Documentation
- Documented the existing row-level styling options `getRowClassName(row)` and `getRowStyle(row)` (grid options and Vue adapter props), which had no README entry.
- Documented the full render hook set (`beforeRowRender`, `afterRowRender`, `beforeCellRender`, `afterCellRender`, `beforeCellDestroy`, `beforeRowDestroy`) and the fact that rows are rebuilt, not recycled, on every render pass.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

**Tree mode**
- `tree: {...}` constructor option now actually activates tree mode; previously it silently configured the manager without enabling it, requiring an explicit `enableTree()` call afterward.
- Tree row keys now respect a configured `rowKey` (field or function) instead of always falling back to `row.id`. Previously, rows without an `id` field could collide onto the same key, so expanding one group could incorrectly expand a sibling group as well; `toggleTreeRow()` also now works correctly when a custom `rowKey` is configured.
- `parentId` tree mode now links parent/child rows using the configured `rowKey` as well.
- Lazily-loaded tree children (`onLoadChildren`) now render correctly even when the row's own `children` field started out as `[]` — that value was previously masking the freshly-loaded children.
- `expandAllTree()` now expands the entire hierarchy in a single call instead of only the currently-visible depth level.

**Editing & Undo/Redo**
- Editing a formula cell and then undoing the edit no longer permanently destroys the formula.
- Pasting over a range no longer overwrites cells that are `editable: false` or when editing is disabled entirely.
- Pasting a multi-column block of tab-separated data now fills every column, not just the first.
- Confirming a cell edit with Enter no longer pushes duplicate entries onto the undo stack — a single Enter press could previously push up to three, and a single Undo would only revert the last (no-op) one.
- `setRows()` (a full dataset replacement) now clears undo/redo history, so a stale action from the previous dataset can no longer overwrite unrelated data in the new one.
- Fixed focus silently dropping to `<body>` after committing a cell edit, which broke grid keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+Z) until the user clicked back into the grid.
- An edit rejected by a column `validator` no longer deletes the cell's existing formula — the formula (and the cell's value) are now left untouched when validation fails, instead of only the value being rolled back while the formula silently disappeared.
- `setCellValue()` now returns `false` (instead of always reporting success) when the underlying patch is rejected — e.g. an edit to the `rowKey` field that would collide with another row — and no longer pushes a phantom undo entry for an edit that never actually applied.

**Filtering & Pagination**
- Advanced filters (`setAdvancedFilter`) are now applied before pagination, so `totalCount` and page count reflect the filtered result instead of the full, unfiltered dataset.
- Advanced filters now evaluate every row independently in group and tree mode (including nested tree descendants), instead of only the top-level rows — a matching child of a non-matching parent is no longer dropped along with it, and a `parentId`-mode child is no longer promoted to a fake root when its parent is filtered out.
- Sorting or filtering with a Web Worker enabled no longer silently ignores custom `comparator`/filter functions — those operations now run on the main thread instead of producing a different, incorrect result with no warning.
- Web Worker filtering now reads the correct data field when a column's `id` differs from its `field`.

**Grouping & Pivot**
- Group aggregates now sum every row in the group instead of only the rows on the currently displayed page.
- `disablePivot()` now restores the grid's original columns instead of leaving the pivot-generated ones in place, and now correctly invalidates cached row heights and re-saves column state, matching every other column-changing API.
- Pivot `count` aggregation now counts non-numeric values (e.g. text) correctly instead of returning `null`. As part of this fix, `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max` now exclude `null`/`undefined` value-field cells from the calculation entirely, rather than silently coercing them to `0` (this mainly changes `avg`, whose denominator no longer counts blank cells — matching typical spreadsheet `AVERAGE` semantics).

**Data & Export**
- `DataStore.patchRow()` now keeps its key index in sync when a patch changes the value of the configured `rowKey` field itself, and refuses the change outright (returning `false`) if it would collide with another row's existing key instead of silently merging the two rows' identities.
- Expanded Master-Detail rows are no longer exported as blank rows in CSV/Excel export.

**Side panel**
- The built-in side panel (columns/filters/view) no longer overlaps and clips the grid's rightmost columns when it's open.
- Keyboard focus on the row-selection checkbox is now also preserved across a re-render (the earlier focus-preservation fix only covered data cells).

**Framework adapters**
- The React and Vue 3 hooks' `selectionCount`, `isAllSelected`, `isSomeSelected`, and `paginationState` now actually update — they previously read fields that didn't exist on the emitted events and stayed stuck at their initial values.

**Packaging & TypeScript types**
- The published React, Vue 2, and Vue 3 type declaration files no longer import from a path outside the package.
- Removed a reference to the nonexistent `GridInstance` type (now `GridCore`) and the nonexistent `useZenithGridReact` export from the type declarations; added the missing `createFormulaPlugin` declaration.
- Fixed a duplicate `onRowContextMenu` property and a non-generic `GridPlugin` type misuse in the Vue 3 declarations.
- `createEchartsPlugin` can now actually be imported from the published package, via `zenith-grid/plugins/echarts`, with its own type declarations.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

**Layout**
- Flex (`flex: N`) columns no longer overflow into an unwanted horizontal scrollbar. `_calculateFlexColumnWidths()` was sizing columns against the full grid root width instead of the actual row viewport width — it now accounts for both the open side panel's reserved margin and the row-selection checkbox column (a 44/68px synthetic column that isn't part of the column registry).

**Packaging & TypeScript types**
- Added missing `GridCore` type declarations for `getLocaleText()`, `commitCellEdit()`, and `cancelCellEdit()`, which existed at runtime but weren't declared in `index.d.ts`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

The project has been renamed from **HighGrid** to **Zenith Grid**. Every public identifier that carried the old name has changed.

#### Package name changed: `highgrid` → `zenith-grid`

```diff
- npm install highgrid
+ npm install zenith-grid

- import { createGrid } from 'highgrid';
- import 'highgrid/styles/grid.css';
+ import { createGrid } from 'zenith-grid';
+ import 'zenith-grid/styles/grid.css';
```

Subpath exports follow the same pattern: `highgrid/vue` → `zenith-grid/vue`, `highgrid/vue2` → `zenith-grid/vue2`, `highgrid/react` → `zenith-grid/react`. The UMD global is now `ZenithGrid` instead of `HighGrid`, and bundle files are `dist/zenith-grid.js`, `dist/zenith-grid-vue.js`, etc.

#### CSS class prefix changed: `ck-high-grid-` → `ck-zenith-grid-`

```diff
- <div class="ck-high-grid-theme-dark">
+ <div class="ck-zenith-grid-theme-dark">
```

#### CSS custom property prefix changed: `--ck-high-grid-` → `--ck-zenith-grid-`

```diff
  :root {
-   --ck-high-grid-accent: #7c3aed;
-   --ck-high-grid-row-height: 48px;
+   --ck-zenith-grid-accent: #7c3aed;
+   --ck-zenith-grid-row-height: 48px;
  }
```

#### Framework adapter API renamed

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `HighGrid` (Vue 2 / Vue 3 component) | `ZenithGrid` |
| `useHighGrid` (React / Vue 3 composable) | `useZenithGrid` |
| `HighGridProps` (TypeScript type) | `ZenithGridProps` |
| `UseHighGridReturn` (TypeScript type) | `UseZenithGridReturn` |

The grid's core API (`createGrid`, `GridCore`, all managers, plugins, and options) is unchanged — only names carrying the old brand were touched.

#### Migrating an existing project

Every rename is a mechanical string substitution, so most projects can migrate with a single pass over their source:

```bash
npm uninstall highgrid && npm install zenith-grid

# macOS/Linux — adjust the file glob to match your project
grep -rl 'HighGrid\|high-grid\|highgrid' src \
  | xargs sed -i 's/HighGrid/ZenithGrid/g; s/ck-high-grid-/ck-zenith-grid-/g; s/--ck-high-grid-/--ck-zenith-grid-/g; s/highgrid/zenith-grid/g'
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse src -File | ForEach-Object {
  (Get-Content $_ -Raw) `
    -replace 'HighGrid', 'ZenithGrid' `
    -replace 'ck-high-grid-', 'ck-zenith-grid-' `
    -replace '--ck-high-grid-', '--ck-zenith-grid-' `
    -replace 'highgrid', 'zenith-grid' | Set-Content $_ -Encoding utf8
}
```

Order matters: replace `HighGrid` before the lowercase forms, and the `ck-`/`--ck-` prefixes before the bare `highgrid` package name.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Flex Columns**: Added support for proportional column widths using `flex` property (AG-Grid style)
  - Use `flex` instead of `width` for responsive, ratio-based column sizing
  - Supports `minWidth` and `maxWidth` constraints with flex columns
  - Automatically recalculates on grid resize
  - Example: `{ id: 'name', flex: 2, minWidth: 120, maxWidth: 300 }`
  - Mixed usage with fixed-width columns is supported
- **Formula Engine Plugin**: Added the new `createFormulaPlugin` using `hot-formula-parser` for full Excel-like functions.
  - Supports arithmetic operators (`+ - * / ^`), comparison operations, and the full formula.js function set (`MIN`, `MAX`, `IF`, `COUNT`, `VLOOKUP`, logical/string functions, etc.).
  - Preserves standard formula authoring via `row._formulas[field] = "=..."` and circular reference guard.
- **Context Menu Enhancements**: Added support for both `action` and `onSelect` callbacks in context menu items, and context menu separators.

### Fixed
- **Korean/CJK IME Input**: Fixed character loss in quick filter when typing Korean, Chinese, or Japanese text
  - Added composition event tracking (`compositionstart`/`compositionend`)
  - Prevented rendering during IME composition to protect character input
  - Added 50ms protection window after composition end for rapid consecutive typing
  - Input focus and cursor position now properly restored after re-rendering
- **Quick Filter Focus**: Fixed input losing focus during typing
  - Preserved user input value during component re-renders
  - Restored cursor position after DOM reconstruction
- **Settings Panel Range Slider**: Prevented slider handles from triggering drag-and-drop actions.
- **Drag & Drop Typos**: Corrected typographical errors in CSS classes, JavaScript code, and event APIs related to row dragging (restored back to `drag`, e.g. `.ck-high-grid-row-drag-handle` and event `row-drag-start`).
- **UTF-8 BOM Test Fix**: Removed dynamic BOM characters in `tests/grid-core.dom.spec.js` that caused parsing errors in Vitest/Vite.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Breaking Changes

#### CSS class prefix changed: `ag-` → `ck-high-grid-`

All internal CSS class names have been renamed from the `ag-` prefix to `ck-high-grid-` to prevent conflicts with AG-Grid and other grid libraries that use the same prefix.

**Before:**
```html
<div class="ag-theme-dark">
  <div id="grid"></div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="ck-high-grid-theme-dark">
  <div id="grid"></div>
</div>
```

---

#### CSS custom property prefix changed: `--ag-` → `--ck-high-grid-`

All CSS design tokens have been renamed from `--ag-` to `--ck-high-grid-`.

**Before:**
```css
#my-grid {
  --ag-accent: #7c3aed;
  --ag-font-size: 15px;
  --ag-row-height: 48px;
}
```

**After:**
```css
#my-grid {
  --ck-high-grid-accent: #7c3aed;
  --ck-high-grid-font-size: 15px;
  --ck-high-grid-row-height: 48px;
}
```

---

### Migration Guide

#### 1. Theme classes

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `ag-theme-dark` | `ck-high-grid-theme-dark` |
| `ag-theme-compact` | `ck-high-grid-theme-compact` |
| `ag-theme-spacious` | `ck-high-grid-theme-spacious` |

#### 2. CSS custom properties (commonly used)

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `--ag-accent` | `--ck-high-grid-accent` |
| `--ag-surface` | `--ck-high-grid-surface` |
| `--ag-ink` | `--ck-high-grid-ink` |
| `--ag-border` | `--ck-high-grid-border` |
| `--ag-font-size` | `--ck-high-grid-font-size` |
| `--ag-row-height` | `--ck-high-grid-row-height` |
| `--ag-header-bg` | `--ck-high-grid-header-bg` |
| `--ag-row-hover-bg` | `--ck-high-grid-row-hover-bg` |
| `--ag-row-selected-bg` | `--ck-high-grid-row-selected-bg` |

#### 3. Custom cell editor class names

If you are using internal class names inside custom cell editors or renderers, update them as well:

**Before:**
```js
input.className = "ag-cell-editor";
```

**After:**
```js
input.className = "ck-high-grid-cell-editor";
```

#### 4. Custom CSS overrides

If you have written custom CSS targeting HighGrid's internal classes, update all selectors:

**Before:**
```css
.ag-row-selected { background: #e0f0ff; }
.ag-header-cell { font-weight: 700; }
.ag-cell-pinned { background: #f8fafc; }
```

**After:**
```css
.ck-high-grid-row-selected { background: #e0f0ff; }
.ck-high-grid-header-cell { font-weight: 700; }
.ck-high-grid-cell-pinned { background: #f8fafc; }
```

#### 5. JavaScript classList manipulation

If you toggle dark mode programmatically:

**Before:**
```js
container.classList.add('ag-theme-dark');
container.classList.remove('ag-theme-dark');
container.classList.toggle('ag-theme-dark');
```

**After:**
```js
container.classList.add('ck-high-grid-theme-dark');
container.classList.remove('ck-high-grid-theme-dark');
container.classList.toggle('ck-high-grid-theme-dark');
```

---

### Why this change?

AG-Grid also uses the `ag-` prefix for its CSS classes and `--ag-` for its design tokens. When both libraries are loaded on the same page, styles bleed into each other and cause visual corruption. The `ck-high-grid-` prefix is unique to HighGrid and eliminates this conflict entirely.
